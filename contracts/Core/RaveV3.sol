/*
 * Rave v3
 * 
 * A multi-chain name service, powered by layer zero. The storage for the names and 
 * all their data is done on Fantom, due to the low costs. Users can register .rave 
 * names in either >=100 RAVE or the equivalent in the chain's native token. The 
 * plus-side to multichain names is that anyone can resolve a name on any chain, 
 * natively. This allows for developers to use .rave names in the stead of addresses 
 * as a sort of verification, or anti-bot measure.
 * 
 * Rave v3 will be compatiable with any ENS-enabled wallet through ENS sub-domains
 * (similar to the current .ftm.fyi solution), just with an on-chain resolver as a
 * pose to an off-chain one.
